in this section i used ,

"h1" tag for the main heading.

"hr" tag is used for givin the horizontal line in my page

"h4" tag is used to give subheading on the webpage, we used h4 because it's size is very smalller than the our main heading h1.

The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to. If the href attribute is not present, the <a> tag will not be a hyperlink.

"a href" this anchor tag we used to give links on our web page, here we didn't given any think so it redirect to our same webpage.

Definition and Usage. The "p" tag defines a paragraph. Browsers automatically add a single blank line before and after each "p" element.

so in this part of webpage we used "p" tag this write this paragraph.

we uses "Strong" tag to give bold effect to our text, we can use "b" tag here in place of "strong", both works same.
